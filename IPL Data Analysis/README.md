In Cricket, IPL stands for 'Indian Premier League', a T20 cricket tournament which was originally established in 2008. The concept of creating an 'Indian Premier League IPL' structure was originally brought up by 'Lalit Modi', the vice president of BCCI. It is traditionally played from April through to June each year.

Modi was ready to create a league that could attract people of all generations, including young cricket lovers. He acknowledged that this T20 format tournament would deliver highâ€“quality matches that would make viewers forget about slow-paced matches like the 5 day Test Match.

Developed on a round-robin concept, the IPL includes group stage games and the last four playoffs. This format allows each team to play with the other team at least one time. The top four teams then move to the previous playoff stage. 

We have 2 parts in this Data Analysis Project. The first part goes into analyzing the history of the IPL and the Second part is all about building a machine learning model that can predict the first innings score of the IPL match.

### Below are the details of both the parts:-

**Part 1 :- Analyzing the history of IPL.**

The Notebook has a list of 40 questions which is been divided into 4 different parts:-

1. General Analysis.
2. Toss Analysis.
3. Batting Analysis.
4. Bowling Analysis.

Below are some of the example questions answered in this notebook:- 

1. When and where was the first IPL match played?
2. How many matches were played in each seasons of IPL? Which seasons had more number of matches played in comparison with the other IPL seasons??
3. Mention the names of all the IPL team franchise in the history of IPL.
4. Which team has won the most number of tosses?
5. Which team has converted most toss wins to match wins?
6. What is the most prefered decision by the teams after winning the toss?
7. Top 5 batsman who have scored the most number of runs in IPL?
8. Which player has scored the most number of centuries?
9. List of Top 10 batsmans who have hit the most number of sixes in an inning.
10. Among all the batsmans that have played more than 1000 balls, which top 10 batsmans have the highest boundary percentage?
11. Among all the batsmans that have played more than 1000 balls, which top 10 batsmans have the highest average strike rates?
12. Among all the batsman that have played more than 500 balls, which batsmans have the highest Average Strike rates in the death overs?
13.  Who have scored the highest individual score in IPL?
14.  What is the percentage of matches won by teams batting 1st?
15.  Which bowler has taken the most number of wickets in IPL?
16.  Most maiden overs bowled by a bowler?
17.  What is the result of an extra ball bowled after a 'No ball'?
18.  Which player has won the most number of Player of the Match awards?

**Part 2 :- Building a Machine Learning Model that predicts the first innings score.**

This notebook is all about building a machine learning model that can predict the first innings score of an IPL match. Though we present some of the accurate machine learning models based of the training data at the end of this notebook, predicting first innings score is full of uncertainity. It depends on various factors on the game day.

The models built to predict the scores are:-

1. Linear Regression.
2. Decision Tree Regressor.
3. Random Forest Regressor.
4. AdaBoost using Linear Regression model.
