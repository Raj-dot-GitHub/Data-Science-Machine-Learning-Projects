## IPL Data Analysis:-

In Cricket, IPL stands for 'Indian Premier League', a T20 cricket tournament which was originally established in 2008. The concept of creating an 'Indian Premier League IPL' structure was originally brought up by 'Lalit Modi', the vice president of BCCI. It is traditionally played from April through to June each year.

Modi was ready to create a league that could attract people of all generations, including young cricket lovers. He acknowledged that this T20 format tournament would deliver highâ€“quality matches that would make viewers forget about slow-paced matches like the 5 day Test Match.

Developed on a round-robin concept, the IPL includes group stage games and the last four playoffs. This format allows each team to play with the other team at least one time. The top four teams then move to the previous playoff stage.
